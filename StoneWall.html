/*
Idea behind this solution is to keep track of the left edges (start points) of the block.
If the current value in the array is greater than the previous, we add another left edge to the stack.
If the current value is less then the previous, we are going through the stack and remove any value greater than current - we reached the right edge!

  let blocks = 0; // total min number of blocks
  let prev = 0; // previous value  
  let left = []; // left edge stack
  
  for (let i=0; i<a.length; i++) {  // loop through the values
    const n = a[i]; // our current value
    if (n>prev) { // if the current value is greater than previous, 
      left.push(n); // we add another left edge
    }
    if (n<prev) { // if the value is less then previous
      while (left.length>0 && n<left[left.length-1]) { // we are checking the left edges stack         
        left.pop(); // remove the item 
        blocks++; // which means that we reached the right edge, so we add to total number of blocks.
      }
      if(n !== left[left.length-1]) left.push(n); // we are adding left edge to the stack only if the current is greater than the last item in the stack
    }
    prev = n;
  }

  return blocks + left.length; // result is total number of counted blocks plus whatever remains in the stack, since we reached the right edge for all
